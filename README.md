----------------------------------------------
KeySight 53230A Universal Frequency Counter Application 

## PROJECT: Time Interval Application 
----------------------------------------------
![pyclockapp_picture.png](Images/pyclockapp_picture.png)
The purpose was to convert auto hot key (ahk) time interval gui into Python TKinter gui and bypass the Keysight standard GUI applicaiton. 

## Issues w/ Auto Hot Key (AHK) Keysight GUI:
---------------------------------------------
    The AHK gui was locking the user out of the computer once the gui started.  The gui had other counters that the technicians no longer used.  And AHK is not a well known language for other programmers to understand and improve performance. 
    Keysight does have a gui interface that can run SCPI commands, but this includes more software for the user to download and become familar.   
    
## SKILLS USED/LANGUAGES:
-------------------------
    * Python-TKinter package
    * AHK- Auto Hot Key is Windows based scritpting language
    * SCPI - Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments  
    * Powershell- desktop icon to run script

## Achievments:
---------------------------------------------
    *Reduced lines of code: AHK(667) to Python(333)
    *Easy transition of knowledge 
    *Faster interval time measurements 

## Process:
---------------------------------------------
    1) Transcribing the AHK language into plain english 
    2) Working with the user to ensure their needs are met
    3) Hand drawn layout of the GUI layout
    4) Reading TKinter and Keysight Frequency Counter documentation 
    5) Finding pieces of GUI methods online
    6) Developing For/While loops to run the time interval measurments
